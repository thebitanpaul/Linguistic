# Linguistic: Real-Time Text to Speech and Voice Cloning AI

Welcome to the **Linguistic** project! This project leverages multiple TTS (Text to Speech) models, including Google Text to Speech (gTTS), Bark TTS, and Coqui TTS, to provide simple real-time text-to-speech generation and extensive voice cloning capabilities for free.

## Features

- **Real-Time Text to Speech**: Convert text to speech in real-time using Google TTS.
- **Generative Text to Speech**: Generate high-quality speech using Bark and Coqui TTS models.
- **Voice Cloning**: Clone voices by providing a sample `.wav` file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface to easily interact with the TTS models.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, PyTorch
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **TTS Models**: Google TTS (gTTS), Bark TTS, Coqui TTS

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linguistic.git
    cd linguistic
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download TTS Models**:
    Download and place the required TTS models (Bark TTS and Coqui TTS) in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask Application**:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Main application file containing the Flask routes and logic.
- **templates/**: Directory containing HTML templates for the web pages.
  - `home.html`: Home page with navigation options.
  - `index.html`: Page for Generative TTS.
  - `gtts.html`: Page for Google TTS.
- **static/**: Directory for static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

## Flask Routes

- **Home Page** (`/`):
  - Description: Welcome page with navigation buttons to TTS and gTTS pages.
  - Template: `home.html`

- **Generative TTS** (`/tts`):
  - Description: Page for generating speech using Bark and Coqui TTS models.
  - Template: `index.html`
  - Method: `POST`
  - Form Inputs: 
    - `text`: Text to be converted to speech.
    - `file`: Upload a `.wav` file for voice cloning.
    - `language`: Language code (default is `en`).
  - Output: Generates and downloads the speech file.

- **Google TTS** (`/gtts`):
  - Description: Page for generating speech using Google TTS.
  - Template: `gtts.html`
  - Method: `POST`
  - Form Inputs: 
    - `text`: Text to be converted to speech.
  - Output: Generates and plays the speech file in the browser.
